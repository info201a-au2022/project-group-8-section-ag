## The Problem
It is no secret that world hunger is an issue; in fact, globally around 1 in 4 people are moderately to severely food insecure. This insecurity only seems to be rising over time, and with Earth recently hitting 8 billion people, it may seem inevitable that such a trend will continue. Understanding the severity and complexities of this problem may be a good first step in to learning where global hunger is the most persistent, and which countries need aid the most.

## Our Questions
We were curious about many things, but mostly we wanted to discover which countries were the most in need of aid. This information would make it easier for countries sending humanitarian aid to concentrate their efforts and address hunger at it's roots. 
To try to find these locations, the main questions we asked were:
- In which countries are children's development most impacted by hunger?
- Which countries have the most food insecure people
- On the global hunger index, which countries score the highest?
## Our Data
We used data from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment), and we found several datasets that show instances of extreme hunger globally. We used a dataset on stunting - which is loss of development due to malnutrition - in children under 5, and analyzed in which countries the highest percentage of children were impacted. We also looked at a dataset on the number of people who were food insecure by millions, showing who was most at risk for starvation. Finally, we also looked at the global hunger index for each country; the global hunger index is a tool that uses different factors that may be signifiers of hunger like stunting or food insecurity to determine a scale for hunger intensity.
## What We Found
We found that child stunting is a incredibly prevalent; in at least 7 countries over 50% of children had stunted development due to malnutrition. These countries were Bangladesh, Burundi, Eritrea, Guatemala, Madagascar, Timor, and Yemen. (*See Summary Page For More Information*)

We also found that the number of severely food insecure people is increasing overall, not decreasing despite global humanitarian efforts. This may be due to a variety of causes, such as population growth, political changes, and climate disasters. Since 2015, the number of severely food insecure people has surpassed 30 million. (*See Summary Page For More Information*)

However, we noticed that this increase in hunger was not as clean cut as entire world data would have you believe. We found that out of the **World's Top 10 "Hungriest" Nations**, there was not always a trendline showing hunger to be worsening over time. Countries such as Timor even saw a sharp decrease in their global hunger index compared to their standing in 2015. This is more proof as to why looking at data by country is significant to understanding how hunger takes hold and how to best eradicate it. (*See Summary Page For More Information*)
