## Abstract
We are concerned with global hunger, and how starvation and food insecurity across countries contribute to the undernourishment of populations. We are concerned with this because prolonged hunger can have negative health effects on many, especially children, and severely impact a personâ€™s quality of life. To address this concern, we plan to compare hunger and malnutrition over time by country, as targeting countries where starvation is the worst is a critical step in coming up with solutions to address food instability.

## The Dataset

## Expected Implications
If we were to answer our research question, we would know the countries across the world that struggle the most with food instability and malnutrition. The implications of this are that humanitarian groups and governments would know best where to direct efforts and funding into reducing starvation. While the ultimate goal is to end hunger in all countries, addressing areas where hunger is especially severe or prolonged may be a good place to start. Presenting hunger data is additionally a good way to encourage people to donate or volunteer to help fight hunger, either in their own country or in others. And since our data is overtime, we will be able to see countries where starvation has been an issue for a long time compared to countries where widespread hunger has become more recent. Analysts may be able to compare this data to world events to see what changes or environments are likely to cause widespread hunger in a country.
