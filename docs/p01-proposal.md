## Abstract
We are concerned with global hunger, and how starvation and food insecurity across countries contribute to the undernourishment of populations. We are concerned with this because prolonged hunger can have negative health effects on many, especially children, and severely impact a person’s quality of life. To address this concern, we plan to compare hunger and malnutrition over time by country, as targeting countries where starvation is the worst is a critical step in coming up with solutions to address food instability.

## Introduction

## Problem Domain
**Background**

- Good health and longevity rests on a foundation afforded by a diet which is both sufficient in caloric and nutritional value. Unfortunately, undernourishment continues to be a leading risk factor for death and other health consequences. By examining the connections between hunger and its causes and effects, a richness of knowledge can be extracted which can allow more urgency around the issue to spring forth, and encourage action on the part of those possessing the means to incite change.

**Direct & Indirect Stakeholders**
- According to Action Against Hunger, global food insecurity most directly affects the impoverished, young children, women, the most socially marginalized individuals, people in conflict settings, and refugees and the displaced.<sub>1</sub> Indirect stakeholders are those working in the food supply chain who experience extra strain thanks to the insatiable demand for what they can provide. Those who increase access to food in critical areas, such as food banks or small family-owned grocery stores located in “food deserts”, have a hard time protecting their stock and preventing people from taking advantage of their generosity.

**Human Values**
- Our human values are how we guide our project to take into account the human element of what we are attempting to record through how we process our data.<sub>2</sub> These are Openness, empathy, love and respect for the dignity and health of our fellow humans.

**Potential Benefits and Harms**
- Benefits of reducing world hunger include reducing its ability to ripple out and harm the development of nations, communities, and even individual humans (as hunger stunts growth).<sub>3</sub> The harms of approaching the issue are minimal, there is mostly very much good that can be done in this area. However, it is possible that by attempting to tackle world hunger rather than general trends in overpopulation, the problem will simply get worse, and we will always be behind the curve on the issue.

## Research Questions
**1. Has global hunger been reduced in any areas of note over the years?**

  **a)** This question is an important one to answer because it helps provide hope and positive feedback to the efforts already in place to end the issue.

  **b)** This is connected to the problem domain because it helps us keep tabs on where the efforts to reduce hunger are currently.

**2. Does world hunger tend to occur in countries that are grouped together, or further apart?**

  **a)** This question is important because it can help us figure out whether climate or trans-state political or social conflicts are causing the worst of the issue.

  **b)** This is connected to the problem domain in that it captures a range of the issue that is more specific than simply “global” and therefore advances the conversation.

**3.   What were politics like in the years when global hunger was at its highest**

  **a)** This question is an important one to answer because it allows us to think about how politics or economics may be impacting world hunger by thinking about events at the times when hunger was at its worst.

  **b)** The connection between this question and the problem domain is that it covers some of the context of the problem domain.




## The Dataset

## Expected Implications
If we were to answer our research question, we would know the countries across the world that struggle the most with food instability and malnutrition. The implications of this are that humanitarian groups and governments would know best where to direct efforts and funding into reducing starvation. While the ultimate goal is to end hunger in all countries, addressing areas where hunger is especially severe or prolonged may be a good place to start. Presenting hunger data is additionally a good way to encourage people to donate or volunteer to help fight hunger, either in their own country or in others. And since our data is overtime, we will be able to see countries where starvation has been an issue for a long time compared to countries where widespread hunger has become more recent. Analysts may be able to compare this data to world events to see what changes or environments are likely to cause widespread hunger in a country.
