### Child Stunting
Our first takeaway is that child stunting is a pressing issue in many countries; so pressing in fact that there were at least 7 countries where over 50% of children were physicallyimpacted by malnutrition. Understanding and addressing where child stuntingis the worst is a necessary step in making sure children are given the necessary access to nutrition.

### Food Insecurity
Our second takeaway is that, globally, food insecurity worldwide looks to be increasing. This is concerning, as populations are also continuing to rise. This means more mouths to feed and a need to address access to food quickly. Looking where food insecurity is the worst and understanding where it has been persistent the longest is important to making sure humanitarian efforts provide food where it is most needed.

### Global Hunger Index
As previously mentioned, is is clear that food insecurity - one of the main contributors to hunger - has been on the rise since 2015. However, our final takeaway is that hunger is only worsening in certain places, not everywhere. This is critical to thinking about how we fight hunger; some countries who have been very high on the global hunger index are reducing hunger, while others are struggling even more. In nations such as Yemen and Madagascar, hunger appears to be spiking. On the other hand, the other nations appear to be experiencing plateaus and decreases. The main implication of this is that the changes in hunger worldwide are not all following a single trend, and that different approaches are called for in countries where trends in hunger, as well as its causes, are different.
